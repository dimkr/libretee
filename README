libretee is a tee(1) implemention licensed under a 2-clause BSD license.

It utilizes POSIX Asynchronous I/O and designed to be efficient, especially when
dealing with large amounts of data.

In contrast with other tee(1) implementations, libretee does not accept any
options and always appends to existing output files.
